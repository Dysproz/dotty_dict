Examples

Yes, I know it's dangerous to follow code examples.
Usually examples aren't in sync with real source code.

But I found a solution ... I hope!

.. note:: | All examples are derived from real code hooked to Pytest.
          | Every change in source code enforce change in examples.
          | **Outdated examples == failed build**.
